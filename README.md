Run `python3 jazz-chords.py`

Pick one of the exercises:

1. Flashcard Practice: Learn and review root 7, root major 7, minor 7, and dominant 7 chords in all keys.
2. Vamp Practice: Create a 4-chord vamp progression for you to practice in different rhythms. The vamp progression includes major 7, minor 7, and dominant 7 chords.
